# SHARP-calc
**Sounding and Hodograph Analysis and Research Program (SHARP)** C++ library for conducting analysis of atmospheric sounding profiles. Based on the NSHARP routines written by John Hart and Rich Thompson at the NWS Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. 

### C++ Version
Code is designed to target the **C++17** standard `-std=c++17`, and generally should not use **C++2X** features. This library is written to work on **RHEL8** systems, and with careful configuration, backwards to **RHEL7**, and should not attempt to use bleeding edge features at risk of breaking compatibility. 

### Style Guide
Though there are likely to be instances where it will need to be deviated from, this code generally attempts to abide by the [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). While line width requirements are generally archaic, where possible we attempt to __keep line lengths to a maximum of 80 characters__ in order to preserve split screen code editing.
