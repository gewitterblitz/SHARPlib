// Trying to mentally sketch out how I want parcel lifting
// and CAPE/CINH integration to work. I want it to be modular
// such that different methods of computing moist adiabats can
// be supported. I want to separate the parcel lifting from the
// actual numerical integration. I want to be able to store and
// reuse the temperature/pressure traces of parcel lifting. Need 
// to support a "fast CAPE/CINH" for effective inflow calculations.
// 
//
// 1) Create the parcel struct
// 2) Define its starting attributes (MU/ML/SFC/etc)
// 3) Lift the parcel/compute temperature trace
// 4) Set LCL/LFC/EL values
// 5) Integrate CAPE/CINH
//
// So, the previous attempt at this workflow didn't work. In order to separate 
// the lifting of the parcel from the actual integration, it required storing
// the parcel virtual temperature values at corresponding profile pressure/height
// levels. Since the size of the profile is initially unknown, and the height of
// the LCL is unknown, the ultimate size of the parcel temperature, pressure, and
// height traces would have required heap allocations. This is clearly a terrible
// idea for a routine that is meant to be called within loops, whether it be the
// Effective Inflow Layer, or working with gridded data, allocating heap memory
// with every iteration is just incredibly stupid and slow. 
//
// So, after some thinking and research, I think a reasonable solution that
// gives flexibility for both parcel lifting routines and integration mechanisms
// is to use C++ functors and tempalte functions. A functor is essentially just
// an object that overloads the () operator. What's neat is it can be inlined
// by the compiler, and passed as a template argument to, say, the parcel
// lifting routine.

 * \brief A functor that calls the Wobus Wetlift funtion
 *
 * This functor is used to wrap the Wobus Wetlift function for parcel
 * lifting routines. These functions are wrapped by functors - classes
 * with ther operator() overloaded - so that functions can be 
 * passed to templates in a way that the compiler can still
 * optimize, rather than using function pointers or lambdas.
 *
 * Specifically, this functor is designed to be passed as a template
 * argument to sharp::lift_parcel, so that the method of computing
 * moist adiabats can be changed without changing the overall parcel
 * lifting algorithm. The reason this is awesome is that the compiler
 * can still optimize and inline this code, while the user can configure
 * the parcel lifting algorithm to their specifications.
