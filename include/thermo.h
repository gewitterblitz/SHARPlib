 * \brief Computes the difference between the wet-bulb potential temperatures for saturated and dry air given the temperature.
 *
 * The Wobus Function (wobf) is defined as the difference between
 * the wet-bulb potential temperature for saturated air (WBPTS)
 * and the wet-bulb potential temperature for dry air (WBPTD) given
 * the same temperature in Celsius.
 *
 * WOBF(T) := WBPTS - WBPTD
 *
 * Although WBPTS and WBPTD are functions of both pressure and
 * temperature, their difference is a function of temperature
 * only. The difference is also proportional to the heat imparted 
 * to a parcel.
 *
 * This function uses a polynomial approximation to the wobus function,
 * fitted to values in Table 78 of PP.319-322 of the Smithsonian Meteorological 
 * Tables by Roland List (6th Revised Edition). Herman Wobus, a mathematician
 * for the Navy Weather Research Facility in Norfolk, VA computed these 
 * coefficients a very long time ago, as he was retired as of the time of 
 * the documentation found on this routine written in 1981.
 *
 * It was shown by Robert Davies-Jones (2007) that the Wobus function has
 * a slight dependence on pressure, which results in errors of up to 1.2
 * degrees Kelvin in the temperature of a lifted parcel. 
 *
 * \param    temperature                     (degC)
 * \return   Sat. Pot. Temperature of Parcel (degC)
