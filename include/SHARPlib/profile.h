 * The Profile struct is used to store the arrays
 * of vertical data associated with either a weather
 * balloon or forecast model sounding profile. In 
 * C++, structs and classes are completely identical. 
 * We use a struct in this case, however, since really
 * it is just a data container, and we don't need
 * things like inheritence, polymorphism, etc that are
 * typically associated with classes. Additionally,
 * in C++ structs have all members and functions 
 * set to 'public' as default, which is desireable!
